Playing around with genetic algorithms and images in python. 

Currently this algorithm randomly generates:
* 	Number of individuals per generation
*	Number of generations
*	Number of survivors between generations
*	Risk of mutation

Then it tries it best to develop a "pixel art"- image (10*10p squares in one colour) with 'test_small.jpg' as inspiration. 

It continues until aborted.
