Playing around with genetic algorithms and images in python. 

Currently this algorithm randomly generates:
	* number of individuals per generation
	* number of generations
	* number of survivors between generations
	* Mutationrisk

Then it tries it best to develop a "pixel art"- image (10*10p squares in one colour) with 'test_small.jpg' as inspiration. 

It continues until aborted.
